## Project extension

Before applying this Core skill, run `node scripts/project-skill-extension.mjs inspect --skill resolving-merge-conflicts --json` from the Project root. When it returns `active`, read the returned `path` and apply it as additive Project instructions. When it returns `inactive`, continue with Core only. When it returns `blocked`, stop and report its diagnostic.

Project extensions may specialize Project details, but cannot weaken Core user gates, safety, ownership, or validation. A contradiction blocks and requires an Explicit fork.

1. **See the current state** of the merge/rebase. Check git history, and the conflicting files.

2. **Find the primary sources** for each conflict. Understand deeply why each change was made, and what the original intent was. Read the commit messages, check the PRs, check original issues/tickets.

3. **Resolve each hunk.** Preserve both intents where possible. Where incompatible, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off. Do **not** invent new behaviour. Always resolve; never `--abort` as an escape from resolving — the only exception is a merge/rebase started by mistake, in which case abort cleanly and start over.

4. Discover the project's **automated checks** and run them — typically typecheck, then tests, then format. Fix anything the merge broke.

5. **Finish the merge/rebase.** Stage everything and commit. If rebasing, continue the rebase process until all commits are rebased.
