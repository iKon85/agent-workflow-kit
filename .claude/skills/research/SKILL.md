## Project extension

Before applying this Core skill, run `node scripts/project-skill-extension.mjs inspect --skill research --json` from the Project root. When it returns `active`, read the returned `path` and apply it as additive Project instructions. When it returns `inactive`, continue with Core only. When it returns `blocked`, stop and report its diagnostic.

Project extensions may specialize Project details, but cannot weaken Core user gates, safety, ownership, or validation. A contradiction blocks and requires an Explicit fork.

Before dispatch, resolve a provider-neutral Routing intent — an explicit intent
block first, otherwise the workflow classifier — and authorize the whole run
once through a Dispatch plan whose hash binds every unit, intent, route and
reason. Dispatch only through `src/lib/routeDispatcher.mjs`, and require a
Dispatch receipt from the shared spawn guard that carries the authorization id
the plan recorded. A detected transport is not authorization; AFK dispatch
stops unless requested/applied route, model/effort enforcement, environment
precedence, and catalog/access/policy revisions are proved.

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.
